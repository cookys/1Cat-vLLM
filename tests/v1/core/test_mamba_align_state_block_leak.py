"""CPU regressions for superseded align-mode Mamba state blocks.

Under async scheduling the step scheduled just before the current one is still
in flight, so ``remove_skipped_blocks`` sees ``processed_computed_tokens`` one
step further behind. The block recorded by the previous allocation is then the
copy source of that in-flight step and must not be freed yet, but it must not
be forgotten either: before the fix the next allocation overwrote the single
``last_state_block_idx`` slot and one state block per chunk was held until the
request finished or was preempted.
